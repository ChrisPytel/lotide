// The function should take in a sentence (as a string)
// and then return a count of each of the letters in that sentence.

// For example, countLetters('LHL') should return results indicating that L appears twice, and H once.

// Before implementing this function, we need to think about how it will report back these counts.
// It's not that we want to know how many H's are in this sentence?, because that would just be a number.
// We need it report back multiple numbers.
